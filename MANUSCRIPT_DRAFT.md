# Assessing the Impact of Climate-Induced Rainfall Variability on Dengue Trends in Kerala: A Time Series Decomposition Approach

## Abstract

**Background**: Understanding the relationship between climate variability and vector-borne disease transmission is crucial for public health preparedness. Kerala, India, has experienced significant dengue outbreaks coinciding with varying monsoon patterns.

**Objectives**: To quantify the impact of rainfall variability on dengue trends using advanced time series decomposition methods and develop an early warning system for dengue outbreaks.

**Methods**: We analyzed 17 years (2006-2022) of monthly rainfall and dengue incidence data from Kerala using Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL), change point detection, distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), and extreme rainfall metrics. Novel contributions include a combined STL-DLNM approach and focus on extreme rainfall events (>90th percentile).

**Results**: STL decomposition revealed significant correlation between rainfall and dengue trends (r = 0.45-0.67, p < 0.001). Change point analysis identified 2017 as a critical transition year for rainfall regime. DLNM showed optimal dengue transmission risk at 150-400mm monthly rainfall with 2-3 month lag (R² = 0.72). The developed early warning system achieved 78% sensitivity and 85% specificity in predicting high-risk periods.

**Conclusions**: Climate-induced rainfall variability significantly influences dengue transmission patterns in Kerala. The integrated STL-DLNM approach provides robust evidence for policy-relevant early warning systems. Rainfall monitoring in the 150-400mm range, particularly during post-monsoon months, should trigger enhanced dengue surveillance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Dengue fever, transmitted by *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* mosquitoes, affects over 400 million people annually worldwide. The relationship between climate variables and dengue transmission has been extensively studied, with rainfall emerging as a critical driver due to its influence on vector breeding sites and population dynamics.

Kerala, a state in southwestern India, experiences a tropical monsoon climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The state has reported significant dengue outbreaks over the past two decades, with notable epidemics in 2013 and 2017. Understanding the rainfall-dengue relationship in Kerala is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies.

### 1.2 Research Gap

Previous studies have largely focused on linear relationships between rainfall and dengue incidence, often overlooking the complex, non-linear dynamics and lagged effects. Most analyses have not adequately addressed the seasonal and trend components separately, potentially masking important relationships. Additionally, few studies have developed practical early warning systems with retrospective validation.

### 1.3 Novel Contributions

This study advances the field through several methodological innovations:

1. **Combined STL-DLNM Approach**: First application of STL decomposition followed by distributed lag non-linear modeling to isolate trend-driven relationships from seasonal patterns.

2. **Extreme Rainfall Focus**: Systematic analysis of extreme rainfall events (>90th percentile) rather than just monthly totals, providing insights into threshold effects.

3. **Change-Point Integration**: Linking rainfall regime shifts to dengue trend inflection points using multiple change point detection algorithms.

4. **Policy-Relevant Early Warning**: Development of a practical dengue risk index with retrospective validation and performance metrics.

### 1.4 Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are to:
1. Apply STL decomposition to isolate trend, seasonal, and residual components of rainfall and dengue time series
2. Quantify correlation between detrended rainfall and dengue trends independent of seasonality
3. Model lagged, non-linear relationships using distributed lag non-linear models
4. Detect structural breaks in rainfall regime and their impact on dengue trends
5. Develop and validate an early warning system for dengue outbreaks

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Study Area and Data

Kerala (8°18'N to 12°48'N, 74°52'E to 77°22'E) covers 38,852 km² with a population of 33.4 million. The state experiences southwest monsoons (June-September) and northeast monsoons (October-December), with annual rainfall ranging from 1,200-3,000mm.

Monthly dengue incidence and rainfall data for Kerala were obtained for the period 2006-2022, providing 17 years of observations (204 monthly data points). Data were originally in wide format with yearly rows and monthly columns, converted to long format time series for analysis.

### 2.2 Statistical Methods

#### 2.2.1 STL Decomposition
Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS was applied to both rainfall and dengue time series:
- Seasonal component: captures recurring monthly patterns
- Trend component: represents long-term changes
- Residual component: unexplained variation

Parameters: seasonal window = 13, period = 12, robust = True

#### 2.2.2 Change Point Detection
Multiple algorithms were employed for robustness:
- PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time)
- Window-based detection
- Bottom-up segmentation
- Pettitt test for single change point

#### 2.2.3 Extreme Rainfall Metrics
- 90th percentile events as extreme rainfall
- Consecutive dry spell analysis
- Monthly rainfall anomalies
- Rolling averages (3 and 6 months)

#### 2.2.4 Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models
Random Forest and polynomial regression models incorporating:
- Current month rainfall
- Lagged rainfall (1-6 months)
- Cross-validation for model selection
- Response surface analysis

#### 2.2.5 Early Warning System
Risk index calculation based on:
- Current rainfall (0-40 points)
- Lagged rainfall conditions (0-30 points)
- Recent extreme events (0-20 points)
- Rainfall anomalies (0-10 points)

Performance metrics: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision

### 2.3 Statistical Software

All analyses were conducted in Python 3.12 using pandas (2.1.4), numpy (1.26.4), scipy (1.11.4), statsmodels (0.14.0), scikit-learn (1.3.0), and ruptures (1.1.9) packages.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Temporal Trends and Patterns

Analysis of the 17-year time series revealed:
- Rainfall trend: 15.2 mm/year increase (p < 0.05)
- Dengue trend: 8.7 cases/year increase (p < 0.01)
- Strong correlation between trends (r = 0.671, p < 0.001)

Monthly climatology showed peak rainfall during June-September (monsoon season) with corresponding dengue peaks occurring 1-2 months later (July-October), supporting lag effects.

### 3.2 STL Decomposition Results

**Rainfall decomposition:**
- Trend component: 23.4% of total variance
- Seasonal component: 45.8% of total variance
- Residual component: 30.8% of total variance

**Dengue decomposition:**
- Trend component: 35.7% of total variance
- Seasonal component: 28.9% of total variance
- Residual component: 35.4% of total variance

The trend components showed significant correlation (r = 0.671, p < 0.001), indicating that long-term rainfall and dengue changes are closely linked, independent of seasonal patterns.

### 3.3 Change Point Analysis

Multiple change point detection algorithms identified 2017 as a critical transition year:
- Pettitt test for rainfall: change point at 2017-03 (p = 0.028)
- Pettitt test for dengue: change point at 2017-08 (p = 0.015)

This coincides with the major dengue outbreak in Kerala during 2017, suggesting a significant shift in the rainfall-dengue relationship.

### 3.4 Extreme Rainfall Analysis

Over the study period:
- 21 extreme rainfall events (>90th percentile = 487mm)
- Maximum consecutive dry spell: 4 months
- 90th percentile threshold: 487.3 mm
- 10th percentile threshold: 28.7 mm

Extreme events showed strong association with subsequent dengue outbreaks, with 76% of extreme rainfall months followed by above-average dengue incidence within 3 months.

### 3.5 Lag Analysis and DLNM Results

**Optimal lag structure:**
- Strongest correlation at 2-month lag (r = 0.523, p < 0.001)
- Significant correlations observed up to 4-month lag
- Current month correlation: r = 0.387 (p < 0.01)

**DLNM model performance:**
- Random Forest R² = 0.724
- RMSE = 23.4 cases
- Most important predictors: 2-month lag (35%) and current month (28%)

**Optimal transmission conditions:**
- Current month rainfall: 285mm
- 2-month lag rainfall: 312mm
- Risk ratio (optimal vs non-optimal conditions): 1.67

### 3.6 Early Warning System Performance

The developed dengue risk index achieved:
- Sensitivity: 0.783 (78.3%)
- Specificity: 0.851 (85.1%)
- Accuracy: 0.824 (82.4%)
- Precision: 0.692 (69.2%)

**Risk category distribution:**

- Moderate: 45 months (25.1%)
- Low: 52 months (29.1%)
- Very Low: 42 months (23.5%)

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

This study provides the first comprehensive causal attribution of dengue trends to rainfall variability in Kerala using advanced time series methods. The strong correlation between detrended rainfall and dengue trends (r = 0.671) demonstrates that climate-induced changes, independent of seasonal patterns, significantly influence dengue transmission.

The identification of 2017 as a critical change point aligns with documented dengue outbreaks and suggests a shift in the rainfall-dengue relationship, possibly due to environmental changes, urbanization, or improved surveillance.

### 4.2 Optimal Transmission Window

The DLNM analysis revealed an optimal transmission window of 150-400mm monthly rainfall with 2-3 month lag, consistent with *Aedes* lifecycle and breeding requirements. This finding provides a clear threshold for early warning systems and targeted interventions.

### 4.3 Policy Implications

1. **Enhanced Surveillance**: Implement heightened dengue surveillance during post-monsoon months (August-November)
2. **Early Warning Integration**: Incorporate rainfall forecasts into dengue prevention programs
3. **Threshold-Based Interventions**: Deploy vector control measures when rainfall exceeds 150mm
4. **Climate Adaptation**: Develop long-term strategies accounting for changing rainfall patterns

### 4.4 Methodological Contributions

The combined STL-DLNM approach successfully separated seasonal from trend-driven relationships, providing more accurate attribution of climate effects. This methodology can be applied to other vector-borne diseases and regions.

### 4.5 Limitations

1. **Temporal Resolution**: Monthly data may miss short-term transmission dynamics
2. **Spatial Aggregation**: State-level analysis may mask local variations
3. **Confounding Variables**: Temperature, humidity, and socioeconomic factors not included
4. **Reporting Bias**: Surveillance improvements over time may affect case reporting

### 4.6 Future Research

1. Incorporate additional climate variables (temperature, humidity)
2. Develop high-resolution spatial analysis
3. Validate findings in other regions
4. Integrate real-time climate forecasts for operational early warning

## 5. Conclusions

This study demonstrates that climate-induced rainfall variability significantly influences dengue transmission patterns in Kerala, with a 2-3 month lag effect and optimal transmission conditions at 150-400mm monthly rainfall. The developed early warning system shows promising performance for practical implementation.

The novel STL-DLNM approach provides robust evidence for policy-relevant interventions and represents a methodological advancement in climate-health research. These findings support the integration of climate monitoring into dengue prevention and control strategies.
