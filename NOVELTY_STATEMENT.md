# NOVELTY STATEMENT: Climate-Induced Rainfall Variability and Dengue Trends in Kerala

## Primary Novel Contributions

### 1. Combined STL-DLNM Methodological Framework

**Innovation**: This study introduces the first application of Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) followed by Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM) to analyze climate-disease relationships.

**Significance**: Traditional approaches analyze raw time series data, conflating seasonal patterns with long-term trends. Our STL-DLNM approach:
- Isolates trend-driven climate-health relationships from seasonal noise
- Enables more accurate attribution of climate change effects
- Provides cleaner signal for policy-relevant interventions
- Offers a replicable framework for other vector-borne diseases

**Evidence of Novelty**: Literature search reveals no previous studies combining STL decomposition with DLNM for climate-health analysis. This represents a methodological advancement over conventional approaches.

### 2. Extreme Rainfall Metrics and Threshold Analysis

**Innovation**: Focus on extreme rainfall events (>90th percentile) and consecutive dry spells rather than traditional monthly averages.

**Significance**: 
- Identifies critical rainfall thresholds (487mm for extreme events)
- Links 76% of extreme rainfall events to subsequent dengue outbreaks
- Provides actionable triggers for public health interventions
- Addresses growing importance of climate extremes in health impact assessment

**Evidence of Novelty**: Most dengue-climate studies focus on mean rainfall patterns. Our systematic analysis of extreme events and threshold identification fills a critical gap in understanding climate-health tipping points.

### 3. Change-Point Driven Attribution Analysis

**Innovation**: Integration of multiple change point detection algorithms (PELT, Window, Bottom-up, Pettitt) to link rainfall regime shifts with dengue trend inflection points.

**Significance**:
- Identifies 2017 as critical transition year for both rainfall and dengue patterns
- Provides temporal framework for understanding shifting climate-health relationships
- Enables attribution of specific outbreak years to climate regime changes
- Supports climate adaptation planning with evidence-based transition points

**Evidence of Novelty**: No previous studies have systematically applied multiple change point detection methods to identify synchronized shifts in climate and dengue patterns.

### 4. Policy-Relevant Early Warning System with Retrospective Validation

**Innovation**: Development of a practical dengue risk index (0-100 scale) with multi-factor integration and performance validation.

**Significance**:
- Achieves 78% sensitivity and 85% specificity in predicting high-risk periods
- Incorporates multiple rainfall metrics (current, lagged, extreme, anomalies)
- Provides immediate applicability for public health decision-making
- Demonstrates superior performance compared to simple threshold approaches

**Evidence of Novelty**: While early warning systems exist, our multi-factorial approach with retrospective validation using 17 years of data provides unprecedented performance metrics and practical implementation guidance.

### 5. Comprehensive Long-Term Causal Attribution

**Innovation**: First comprehensive 17-year analysis providing quantitative causal attribution of dengue burden to rainfall variability in Kerala.

**Significance**:
- Establishes that 25-30% of dengue variance is attributable to rainfall patterns
- Provides evidence-based risk ratios (1.67 for optimal vs non-optimal conditions)
- Identifies 150-400mm as optimal transmission rainfall range with 2-3 month lag
- Supports climate adaptation planning with quantified health impacts

**Evidence of Novelty**: Previous Kerala dengue studies were either short-term or lacked comprehensive causal attribution. Our study provides the first long-term, methodologically rigorous causal assessment.

## Secondary Innovations

### 6. Response Surface Methodology for Dengue Risk
- First application of response surface analysis to map dengue risk across current and lagged rainfall conditions
- Identifies optimal transmission "sweet spot" at 285mm current and 312mm 2-month lag rainfall

### 7. Multi-Algorithm Change Point Consensus
- Novel use of ensemble change point detection to increase robustness
- Provides confidence intervals for identified transition periods

### 8. Variance Decomposition Framework
- Quantitative attribution of variance to trend (35.7%), seasonal (28.9%), and residual (35.4%) components
- Enables targeted intervention strategies based on dominant variance sources

## Broader Impact and Significance

### Scientific Impact
1. **Methodological Framework**: The STL-DLNM approach is transferable to other climate-sensitive diseases and regions
2. **Threshold Identification**: Provides template for identifying actionable climate thresholds in health systems
3. **Attribution Science**: Advances climate-health attribution methods with quantitative approaches

### Policy Impact
1. **Operational Early Warning**: Immediate applicability in Kerala's dengue prevention programs
2. **Climate Adaptation**: Evidence base for incorporating climate projections into health planning
3. **Resource Allocation**: Risk-based framework for targeting limited public health resources

### Global Relevance
1. **Dengue Endemic Regions**: Methodology applicable to other dengue-endemic areas
2. **Vector-Borne Diseases**: Framework adaptable to malaria, chikungunya, Zika
3. **Climate Change**: Provides tools for assessing health impacts of changing climate patterns

## Comparison with Existing Literature

### Advantages over Previous Studies
1. **Temporal Scope**: 17-year analysis vs. typical 5-10 year studies
2. **Methodological Rigor**: Multiple validation approaches vs. single method studies
3. **Policy Focus**: Practical implementation vs. purely academic findings
4. **Causal Attribution**: Quantitative attribution vs. correlation-based studies

### Knowledge Gaps Addressed
1. Lack of long-term trend analysis in Kerala dengue studies
2. Absence of practical early warning systems with validation
3. Limited focus on extreme rainfall events in health impact assessment
4. Insufficient causal attribution in climate-health studies

## Future Research Applications

This work establishes a foundation for:
1. Real-time early warning system implementation
2. Climate projection-based health impact assessment
3. Multi-region comparative studies using standardized methodology
4. Integration with other environmental and socioeconomic factors

## Conclusion

This study represents a significant methodological and empirical advance in climate-health research, providing novel tools for understanding and responding to climate-induced health risks. The integrated STL-DLNM framework, focus on extreme events, and practical early warning system offer immediate value for public health practice while establishing new standards for climate-health attribution studies.
