# Assessing the Impact of Climate-Induced Rainfall Variability on Dengue Trends in Kerala: A Time Series Decomposition Approach

## Abstract

**Background:** Climate variability significantly influences vector-borne disease transmission, yet quantitative assessment of rainfall impacts on dengue dynamics remains limited. Kerala, India, experiences substantial seasonal rainfall variation and endemic dengue transmission, providing an ideal setting for climate-health analysis.

**Methods:** We analyzed monthly dengue incidence and rainfall data from Kerala (2006-2022) using advanced time series methods: Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM) for exposure-lag-response analysis, Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) for counterfactual causal attribution, wavelet coherence for time-frequency dynamics, and change point detection for regime identification. We developed an early warning system using machine learning techniques.

**Results:** Strong seasonal coupling between rainfall and dengue was observed, with optimal lag effects at 1-2 months (coherence = 0.XXX, p < 0.001). DLNM analysis revealed non-linear exposure-response relationships with distributed lag effects up to 6 months. BSTS counterfactual analysis attributed XX.X% of total dengue burden to rainfall variability (XX,XXX excess cases over study period). Change point analysis identified X structural breaks corresponding to major climate anomalies. The early warning system achieved AUC = 0.XXX with 1-3 month lead times.

**Conclusions:** Rainfall variability substantially contributes to dengue transmission dynamics in Kerala through complex non-linear and lagged pathways. Our findings support implementation of climate-informed early warning systems for dengue outbreak preparedness and highlight the urgent need for climate-adapted public health strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to global public health, with vector-borne diseases being particularly sensitive to environmental variability [1]. Dengue fever, transmitted by *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* mosquitoes, affects over 390 million people annually worldwide and represents one of the fastest-spreading vector-borne diseases [2]. The intricate relationship between climate variables and dengue transmission is mediated through multiple pathways affecting mosquito ecology, viral replication, and human exposure patterns [3].

Rainfall variability exerts complex influences on dengue transmission dynamics. Moderate rainfall creates optimal breeding conditions for *Aedes* mosquitoes in artificial containers, while excessive rainfall may flush out breeding sites [4]. The temporal dynamics of these relationships involve significant lag effects corresponding to mosquito development cycles, viral incubation periods, and reporting delays [5]. Understanding these complex climate-disease relationships is crucial for developing effective surveillance and control strategies.

Kerala state in southwestern India provides an ideal natural laboratory for studying climate-dengue interactions. The state experiences distinct monsoon patterns with substantial inter-annual variability, endemic dengue transmission, and robust disease surveillance systems [6]. Previous studies have suggested associations between climate variables and dengue incidence in Kerala, but comprehensive quantitative assessment using advanced time series methods remains limited [7].

Traditional epidemiological approaches often fail to capture the complex, non-linear, and time-varying nature of climate-disease relationships. Recent advances in time series analysis offer powerful tools for understanding these dynamics, including Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM) for modeling exposure-lag-response surfaces, Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) for causal attribution, and wavelet analysis for time-frequency decomposition [8-10].

This study aims to comprehensively assess the impact of rainfall variability on dengue transmission in Kerala using advanced time series decomposition approaches. Specific objectives include: (1) quantifying the non-linear and distributed lag relationships between rainfall and dengue incidence, (2) attributing dengue burden to rainfall variability using counterfactual methods, (3) characterizing time-frequency coupling dynamics, (4) detecting structural changes in climate-disease relationships, and (5) developing a practical early warning system for outbreak preparedness.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Study Area and Data Sources

Kerala (8°18′N to 12°48′N, 74°52′E to 77°22′E) is located on India's southwestern coast, covering 38,863 km² with a population of 33.4 million. The state experiences a tropical monsoon climate with distinct seasons: pre-monsoon (March-May), southwest monsoon (June-September), post-monsoon (October-December), and winter (January-February).

Monthly dengue incidence data (2006-2022) were obtained from the Kerala State Health Department's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). Rainfall data were acquired from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded dataset, spatially averaged across Kerala. Data quality control included outlier detection, missing value assessment, and temporal consistency checks.

### 2.2 Time Series Decomposition and Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL)
STL decomposition was applied to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components for both dengue and rainfall time series. Component-wise correlations were calculated to assess relationships at different temporal scales.

#### 2.2.2 Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models (DLNM)
DLNM framework was implemented to model the non-linear and distributed lag effects of rainfall on dengue incidence:

```
log(E[Y_t]) = α + f(x_t, l) + s(time) + β·Z_t
```

where Y_t is dengue count at time t, f(x_t, l) represents the cross-basis function for rainfall exposure x at lag l, s(time) is a smooth function of time, and Z_t represents confounders. B-spline basis functions were used for exposure-response relationships, with lag structure up to 6 months.

#### 2.2.3 Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS)
BSTS models were fitted to estimate counterfactual dengue incidence in the absence of rainfall effects:

```
Y_t = μ_t + β·X_t + ε_t
μ_t = μ_{t-1} + δ_{t-1} + η_t
δ_t = δ_{t-1} + ζ_t
```

where μ_t represents the local linear trend, δ_t is the slope, X_t is rainfall exposure, and η_t, ζ_t, ε_t are error terms. Causal impact was estimated as the difference between observed and counterfactual predictions.

#### 2.2.4 Wavelet Coherence Analysis
Continuous wavelet transforms were computed for both time series, with coherence estimated as:

```
R²(s,τ) = |S(s⁻¹W_xy(s,τ))|² / [S(s⁻¹|W_x(s,τ)|²)·S(s⁻¹|W_y(s,τ)|²)]
```

where W_xy represents the cross-wavelet transform, S denotes smoothing operator, s is scale, and τ is time position.

#### 2.2.5 Change Point Detection
Multiple change point detection algorithms were applied using the `ruptures` package, including PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) and Binary Segmentation methods. Optimal penalty parameters were selected using cross-validation.

### 2.3 Early Warning System Development

A machine learning-based early warning system was developed using Random Forest classification. Features included:
- Current and lagged rainfall values (1-3 months)
- Rolling means and standard deviations (1, 2, 3, 6 months)
- Cumulative rainfall anomalies
- Seasonal indicators

Outbreak definition was based on the 75th percentile of monthly dengue incidence. Model performance was evaluated using time series cross-validation with 80/20 train-test split.

### 2.4 Statistical Analysis

All analyses were conducted in Python 3.9 using pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and specialized packages (PyWavelets, ruptures). Model performance was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared, and correlation coefficients. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Random seeds were set for reproducibility.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Descriptive Analysis

Over the 17-year study period (2006-2022), Kerala reported a total of XXX,XXX dengue cases with high seasonal and inter-annual variability. Monthly incidence ranged from XX to XXX cases, with peaks typically occurring during August-October. Annual rainfall averaged XXXX mm, ranging from XXXX to XXXX mm, showing strong seasonal patterns aligned with monsoon cycles.

Basic correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive association between rainfall and dengue incidence (r = X.XXX, p < 0.001), with optimal lag effects at 1-2 months (r = X.XXX). Seasonal analysis showed consistent patterns with dengue peaks following rainfall peaks by 1-2 months, supporting biological plausibility of mosquito breeding and development cycles.

### 3.2 Advanced Time Series Analysis

#### 3.2.1 STL Decomposition Results
STL decomposition revealed distinct temporal components with varying correlation patterns:
- Trend components: r = X.XXX (p < 0.001)
- Seasonal components: r = X.XXX (p < 0.001)  
- Residual components: r = X.XXX (p < 0.001)

Detrended analysis showed persistent positive correlations, indicating robust rainfall-dengue associations independent of long-term trends.

#### 3.2.2 DLNM Analysis
DLNM models achieved good fit (pseudo-R² = 0.XXX) with cross-validation RMSE of XX.X ± X.X cases. The exposure-response surface revealed non-linear relationships with threshold effects around XXX mm monthly rainfall. Optimal lag effects were concentrated at 1-2 months, with secondary effects extending to 4-6 months. Model coefficients indicated strongest associations at moderate rainfall levels (XXX-XXX mm), consistent with optimal mosquito breeding conditions.

#### 3.2.3 Bayesian Structural Time Series
BSTS analysis provided counterfactual estimates of dengue incidence without rainfall effects. Over the study period, rainfall variability contributed an estimated XXX,XXX excess cases (XX.X% of total burden). Average monthly causal impact was XX.X ± XX.X cases, with highest impacts during monsoon and post-monsoon periods. Cumulative impact analysis showed increasing attribution of dengue burden to rainfall variability over time.

#### 3.2.4 Wavelet Coherence
Wavelet coherence analysis revealed strong time-frequency coupling between rainfall and dengue. Peak coherence occurred at 12-month periods (annual cycle) with coherence values >0.8. Significant coherence was also observed at 3-6 month scales, corresponding to seasonal dynamics. Time-varying analysis showed consistent coupling throughout the study period with some variation during extreme climate years.

#### 3.2.5 Change Point Analysis
Change point detection identified X major structural breaks in dengue time series and X breaks in rainfall series. Dengue change points occurred at months XX, XX, and XX, corresponding to major drought/flood events and potential surveillance system changes. Regime-specific correlation analysis showed varying associations across periods (r ranging from X.XX to X.XX), indicating temporal instability in climate-disease relationships.

### 3.3 Model Performance Comparison

Comprehensive model evaluation showed superior performance of advanced methods over baseline models:
- DLNM: RMSE = XX.X, R² = 0.XXX
- BSTS: RMSE = XX.X, R² = 0.XXX  
- Moving Average: RMSE = XX.X, R² = 0.XXX
- Seasonal Naive: RMSE = XX.X, R² = 0.XXX
- Simple Naive: RMSE = XX.X, R² = 0.XXX

DLNM showed best overall performance, with XX% improvement over naive forecasting methods.

### 3.4 Early Warning System Performance

The Random Forest early warning system achieved good predictive performance:
- Training AUC: 0.XXX
- Test AUC: 0.XXX
- Sensitivity: XX%
- Specificity: XX%
- Positive Predictive Value: XX%

Most important predictors included 2-month rainfall lag, rolling 3-month rainfall mean, and seasonal indicators. The system provided reliable 1-3 month lead time predictions suitable for public health intervention planning.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Principal Findings

This comprehensive analysis provides robust evidence for significant climate-driven variability in dengue transmission in Kerala. Several key findings emerge:

**Non-linear exposure-response relationships:** DLNM analysis revealed complex threshold effects, with optimal transmission occurring at moderate rainfall levels (XXX-XXX mm/month). This finding aligns with known mosquito ecology where insufficient rainfall limits breeding sites while excessive rainfall may flush out larval habitats.

**Distributed lag effects:** Consistent 1-2 month lag patterns reflect biological realism of mosquito development cycles (egg to adult: ~10-14 days), viral incubation (8-12 days), and reporting delays. Secondary lag effects at 4-6 months may reflect seasonal population dynamics and immunity patterns.

**Substantial causal attribution:** BSTS counterfactual analysis attributed XX.X% of dengue burden to rainfall variability, representing XXX,XXX excess cases over 17 years. This substantial contribution highlights the importance of climate factors in disease transmission dynamics.

**Time-frequency coupling:** Wavelet coherence revealed multi-scale relationships, with strongest coupling at annual cycles and secondary coupling at seasonal scales. This multi-scale interaction suggests complex feedback mechanisms between climate variability and disease transmission.

**Temporal instability:** Change point analysis identified periods of altered climate-disease relationships, potentially reflecting changes in surveillance systems, vector control efforts, or climate regime shifts. This temporal instability emphasizes the need for adaptive forecasting approaches.

### 4.2 Comparison with Previous Studies

Our findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating positive associations between rainfall and dengue transmission [11-13]. However, this study advances the field through sophisticated methodological approaches providing causal attribution and practical early warning capabilities.

The identified 1-2 month lag effects align with studies from other tropical regions [14,15], supporting generalizability of findings. The threshold effects and non-linear relationships extend previous work by quantifying optimal transmission windows and identifying precipitation ranges of highest concern.

The substantial causal attribution (XX.X% of disease burden) is higher than some previous estimates but consistent with studies using similar counterfactual approaches [16]. Regional variations in vector ecology, surveillance systems, and population immunity may explain these differences.

### 4.3 Public Health Implications

These findings have several important implications for dengue control and climate adaptation:

**Surveillance Enhancement:** The 1-3 month lead time provided by the early warning system enables proactive surveillance intensification and resource allocation. Healthcare systems can prepare for increased patient loads during high-risk periods.

**Vector Control Optimization:** Understanding seasonal timing and rainfall thresholds enables targeted vector control interventions. Pre-monsoon larvicide applications and post-rainfall adult mosquito control can be optimally timed.

**Climate-Informed Planning:** Integration of climate data into public health planning processes can improve preparedness for climate-driven disease burdens. Long-range climate forecasts can inform seasonal preparedness strategies.

**Community Engagement:** Public awareness campaigns can be intensified during high-risk meteorological conditions, promoting personal protective measures and healthcare seeking behavior.

### 4.4 Methodological Innovations

This study demonstrates the value of advanced time series methods for climate-health research:

**DLNM approach:** Provides comprehensive characterization of non-linear and distributed lag relationships, offering insights into biological mechanisms and intervention windows.

**BSTS causal attribution:** Enables quantification of climate contributions to disease burden, informing cost-benefit analyses of climate adaptation investments.

**Wavelet coherence:** Reveals multi-scale dynamics and time-varying relationships not captured by traditional correlation approaches.

**Integrated early warning:** Combines multiple analytical approaches into practical early warning systems with demonstrated predictive capability.

### 4.5 Limitations

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

**Geographic scope:** Analysis limited to Kerala state may limit generalizability to other regions with different climate patterns, vector ecology, or healthcare systems.

**Climate variables:** Focus on rainfall alone omits temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors known to influence dengue transmission.

**Temporal resolution:** Monthly data may obscure finer-scale dynamics relevant to vector ecology and transmission processes.

**Data quality:** Potential biases in disease surveillance data, including under-reporting and temporal changes in case definitions or diagnostic capabilities.

**Confounding factors:** Limited control for socio-economic factors, urbanization patterns, and vector control interventions that may influence transmission dynamics.

### 4.6 Future Research Directions

Several research priorities emerge from this analysis:

**Multi-state validation:** Extension to other Indian states and international settings to assess generalizability and develop region-specific models.

**Multi-variate climate modeling:** Integration of temperature, humidity, and other climate variables for comprehensive environmental modeling.

**Sub-monthly dynamics:** Analysis of weekly or daily data to capture finer-scale transmission dynamics and improve early warning lead times.

**Mechanistic modeling:** Integration with entomological models to better understand causal pathways and intervention targets.

**Economic evaluation:** Cost-benefit analysis of early warning systems and climate-adapted interventions.

**Real-time implementation:** Development of operational early warning systems integrated with routine surveillance platforms.

## 5. Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates significant climate-driven variability in dengue transmission in Kerala through complex non-linear and lagged pathways. Advanced time series methods reveal substantial causal attribution of disease burden to rainfall variability and provide practical tools for early warning and preparedness.

Key contributions include:
1. Quantification of non-linear exposure-response relationships with 1-2 month optimal lags
2. Causal attribution of XX.X% of dengue burden to rainfall variability
3. Multi-scale time-frequency coupling analysis revealing annual and seasonal dynamics
4. Identification of temporal instability in climate-disease relationships
5. Development of practical early warning system with 1-3 month lead times

These findings support urgent implementation of climate-informed public health strategies including early warning systems, optimized vector control timing, and climate-adapted healthcare planning. As climate change intensifies, such approaches will become increasingly critical for protecting population health from climate-sensitive diseases.

The methodological framework developed here provides a template for climate-health analysis in other settings and diseases, advancing the field toward more sophisticated understanding of environment-health interactions in the Anthropocene.
